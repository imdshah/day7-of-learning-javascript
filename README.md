# Day 7 of learning JavaScript
- Today I learned more about functions, function declaration, and function expression.
- Also learned about hoisting and scope.

## Functions in JavaScript
-Functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task.

## Hoisiting in JavaScript
- Hoisting is JavaScript’s behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope during the memory creation phase.
- Only declarations are hoisted and not initialisations
- Function declarations are hoisted, but function expressions aren't.

## Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
- An IIFE is a function that runs immediately after it is defined.
